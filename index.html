                    We look broadly and holistically to identify root causes,
                    whether they are technical, structural, or behavioural in nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We build up capabilities within your team using <nobr>hands-on</nobr> direct interactions, professional coaching,
                    facilitation and workshops, and classroom training.

                    Your teams will benefit from our experience, gain confidence to make technical and process decisions,
                    and learn to work together effectively.

                <p>Over the course of a release cycle or sprint, we spend half a day pairing with each team member, observing and guiding.</p>
                <p>At the end of a cycle, we synthesize our observations and make further recommendations.</p>
                <p>This can begin as an exploratory exercise or with a direct goal in mind, e.g. improving observability, deployment frequency, code review quality.</p>
            </div>
