            Embedded training and mentoring for software teams.
        </p>
        <p>
            We look broadly and holistically to identify root causes,
            whether they are technical, structural, or behavioural in nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            We build up capabilities within your team using <nobr>hands-on</nobr> direct interactions, professional coaching,
            facilitation and workshops, and classroom training.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your teams will benefit from our experience, gain confidence to make technical and process decisions,
            and learn to work together effectively.
        </p>
