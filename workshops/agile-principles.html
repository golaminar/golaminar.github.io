          As experienced engineers and engineering leaders, we‚Äôve regularly seen teams apply practices that didn‚Äôt solve the problems they had.</p>
        <p>
          <i>Kanban! Story points! Backlog refinement!</i> And when things don‚Äôt work out, you're often told that you're not following the methods ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù.

      <h3>What will be covered</h3>
      <p>
        The workshop will teach you sound process principles that help you recognize, articulate, and address dysfunctions. Together we‚Äôll explore:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why working in big chunks is expensive and slow. Which techniques help you break work down to deliver value more quickly.</li>
        <li>How backlogs harm team happiness and productivity. How to set limits to say yes to the right things.</li>
        <li>How to recognize unintentional bottlenecks.</li>
        <li>How to transform collaboration to have lower stakes, be less stressful, and be more effective.</li>
        <li>How planning for failure can lead you to success faster.</li>
        <li>How to avoid hindering your development flow for the sake of strict adherence to a process.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What you can expect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>üî® Interactive exercises that build your intuition</li>
        <li>üí¨ Thoughtful discussion with peers</li>
        <li>üß† Critical re-evaluation of Agile rituals</li>
        <li>üí° ‚ÄúA-ha‚Äù moments</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- <ul class="results">
        <li>Delivering fast doesn‚Äôt have to be stressful, but it often is.</li>
        <li>Do you feel constrained by your processes?</li>
        <li>What would it take for you to feel qualified and confident to change them?</li>
        <li>‚òû Debug your delivery process.</li>
