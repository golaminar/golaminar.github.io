            <p>Over the course of my time at SoundCloud, I was a UX consultant, full-stack developer, prototype designer, product
            designer, product manager, technical leader and cultural leader. Since 2017, I managed engineers, stepping from team
            manager to director, then engineering group lead and VP Engineering. I led engineering across customer facing products,
            with a mixed team of directors, managers, and individual contributors. As a member of the Engineering Leadership Team, I
            evolved policies and processes, and partnered with other leads to steer the engineering organization.</p>

                <!--  coaching -->
                <p>Tiffany’s coaching was on point. She took the lead whenever necessary without taking away the work I was supposed
                    to do. I felt a lot more confident about handling similar situations more autonomously in the future.</p>

                <!-- facilitation -->
                <p>Tiffany is a great communicator. She is very relatable and spreads good vibes in every encounter. At the same
                    time she challenges assumptions and quickly finds a precise summary for what someone meant to say. She always
                    does so in an inclusive and supportive way, enabling others.</p>
