                </p>
                <p>
                    I have 20+ years of experience working hands-on across software development, product management, and
                    design. I love cleaning up messes, refactoring, streamlining, and troubleshooting systems of all kinds.
                    My flexibility, pragmatism, and wide experience opens up the solution space I explore and the tools I employ.
                    I operate with high ethical standards for mutual respect, equity, and empathy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m looking to work with engineering orgs of 50 and under,
                    and especially those where organizational or technological evolution is needed.
                    Having seen SoundCloud through a decade of growth spurts, I’m eager
                    to help other teams make these critical transitions.
                </p>

                <h3>zolar GmbH – Dec 2023 – June 2025</h3>

                <p>
                    When I joined zolar, it was a residential PV system sales and installation company that worked with third-party installers,
                    and was aiming to streamline operations through software-driven efficiency.
                    As it became clear that the renewable energy transition is being powered by those same small to mid-sized local installers,
                    zolar pivoted to a SaaS model—offering an AI-powered, end-to-end software platform to the very companies it once contracted.
                </p>
                
                <h4 style="font-style: italic;">AI Squad Lead – Sept 2024 – June 2025</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Led a small, agile AI-focused team developing smart features for a SaaS platform supporting solar installation professionals.</li>
                    <li>The platform evolved from a prior internal tool into a standalone, AI-powered solution streamlining customer acquisition through to installation.</li>
                </ul>

                    SoundCloud’s inclusive work environment.

                <p>Tiffany’s coaching was on point. She took the lead whenever necessary without taking away the work I was supposed
                    to do. I felt a lot more confident about handling similar situations more autonomously in the future.</p>
