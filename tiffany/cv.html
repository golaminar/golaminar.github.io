                <p>
                    I have 20+ years of experience working hands-on across software development, product management, and
                    design. I love cleaning up messes, refactoring, streamlining, and troubleshooting systems of all kinds.
                    My flexibility, pragmatism, and wide experience opens up the solution space I explore and the tools I employ.
                    I operate with high ethical standards for mutual respect, equity, and empathy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m looking to work with engineering organizations of 50 people and under,
                    and especially those where organizational or technological evolution is needed.

                <p>
                    When I joined zolar, it was focused on selling and installing residential PV systems through third-party installers.

                <p>Tiffany is an inspiration and a role model for me from the first moment I met her and I am so happy I had her as
                    my manager.</p>

                <!--  coaching -->
                <p>Tiffany’s coaching was on point. She took the lead whenever necessary without taking away the work I was supposed
                    to do. I felt a lot more confident about handling similar situations more autonomously in the future.</p>

                <!-- facilitation -->
                <p>Tiffany is a great communicator. She is very relatable and spreads good vibes in every encounter. At the same
                    time she challenges assumptions and quickly finds a precise summary for what someone meant to say. She always
                    does so in an inclusive and supportive way, enabling others.</p>
