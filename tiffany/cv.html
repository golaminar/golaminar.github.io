                <h3>SoundCloud – 2011-2022</h3>
                <p>
                    Working across software development, product management, design, and engineering
                    leadership, I repeatedly defined my own role and tackled business-critical problems, and was a sought-after consultant for many
                    initiatives. As a cultural leader, I shaped SoundCloud’s inclusive work environment.
                </p>

                <h4 style="font-style: italic;">2020-2022: VP of Engineering, Commercial Platform</h4>
                <p>
                    Drove strategic technical change across the commercial platform group to support international expansion, data-driven growth, and targeted marketing.
                    Evolved hiring and promotion processes for fairness and efficiency.
                    In response to leadership upheaval, I steered and represented the Engineering Leadership Team and ultimately led 100+
                    people in 12 teams delivering customer-facing products.
                </p>

                <h4 style="font-style: italic;">2017-2019: Engineering Directer, Payments</h4>
                <p>
                    Was tapped to step in to rebuild the business-critical Payments Team.
                    Led the stabilization of the multi-platform tech stack, expanded currencies and payment methods, launched two new subscription products, and introduced 3D Secure.
                    Led data-driven initiatives that reduced involuntary churn by 20%.
                </p>

                <h4 style="font-style: italic;">2015-2017: Product Manager & Tech Lead, Authentication</h4>
                <p>
                    Initiated the founding of the Sign-in Team to modernize and simplify the authentication user experience and tech stack.
                    Brought single sign-on to the soundcloud.com domain, and developed novel security features and sign-in methods in collaboration with the Security Team. Served as PM and consultant for authentication, authorization, and security topics more broadly.
                </p>

                <h4 style="font-style: italic;">2011-2015: Developer — Tech Lead — Product Manager — UX Consultant — Product Designer</h4>
                <p>
                    Built out the entirety of SoundCloud’s user administration system, the indispensible tool for diagnosing and solving end-user issues. Designed and implemented auditable administrative functionality across
                    SoundCloud’s suite of microsystems, and its core monolith.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Was an architect and consultant for SoundCloud’s
                    content and rights management systems, including designing
                    and implementing all three sides (uploader,

                <!--  coaching -->
                <p>Tiffany’s coaching was on point. She took the lead whenever necessary without taking away the work I was supposed
                    to do. I felt a lot more confident about handling similar situations more autonomously in the future.</p>

            <div class="col testimonial">
                <!-- facilitation -->
                <p>Tiffany is a great communicator. She is very relatable and spreads good vibes in every encounter. At the same
                    time she challenges assumptions and quickly finds a precise summary for what someone meant to say. She always
                    does so in an inclusive and supportive way, enabling others.</p>

                    my manager.</p>
