            <p>Let’s run some numbers to see why. Imagine we pay a sole developer €50 per hour<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-3-source">3</a></sup>, i.e. €2,000 per 40 hour work week. Let’s also assume that the ongoing value of what they deliver, once released, is €2,000 per week. Then let’s imagine there are 5 items in the development backlog, each requiring 1 week of that developer’s time to complete. A new item entering the queue will need to wait 5 weeks for the other items on the queue to be completed before it receives attention. So the cost of delay we pay on that new item is €10,000. In that time, we’re also paying the cost of delay on the other items in the queue – €8,000 for the 5th item with 4 in front of it, €6,000 for the next item up, and so on. So in the time it takes for that new item to reach the front of the queue, we have paid €30,000 in delay cost for the items in this queue. Meanwhile, 5 weeks of developer time have passed, costing us €10,000.</p>

            <p>It <em>is</em> possible to address the problem of growing queues by making teams more productive. If we can add people, or train the existing people, we can increase the amount of <em>stuff</em> the team can handle in a given time period. If we don't correspondingly increase demand on the team (and that's a pretty big 'if', in my experience) we would expect to see shorter queues. Two problems with this: first, it's expensive. Training costs money. Extra people cost money. Retaining good people costs money. If there are cheaper ways to achieve the same goal of shorter queues, we should explore them. Second, there are limits to what you can do on the capacity side -- people are only ever going to be <em>this</em> good at programming until a new paradigm comes along, they only have <em>this</em> much stamina, and a group of people collaborating on something can only be <em>this</em> size before the coordination efforts required start to be overwhelming. On the other hand, demand is potentially unlimited, and is likely to increase as stakeholders ask "we've added people to this team, shouldn't we be able to do more now?" Adding capacity works only in its relation to demand. That's at the macro (product backlog) level. At the micro level (e.g. code review queue), you can do similar -- make people's code reviews 50% faster. But again, that's expensive, and no amount of making people better at an activity will help if they're simply not spending enough of their time on that activity compared to others.</p>

              <figcaption>This illustration shows the behaviour and costs of a backlog operating over time,
                where items enter the queue at random intervals and developement velocity is subject to random variablity.
                For simplicity, developement times and costs have been applied uniformly, not accounting for working hours.
                Such queues operating at nearly 100% utilization have a tendency to grow,
                which means the cost of delay per item grows.
                For details about how these simulations are implemented,
                see the footnotes.<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-3-source">3</a></sup></figcaption>

            <p>We need to avoid the scenario where our queues continue to grow and our cost of delay increases -- eventually (but sooner than we intuitively expect) reaching the point where it outweighs all other costs. This scenario in the real world wouldn't show up as a negative on our balance sheet, but as a decreasing ability to innovate, to satisfy customer demand, or to compete with the brand-new entrant to our market, eventually posing existential risks to the organization. If we want to avoid it, we must do something to prevent queues from getting out of control. That's what we'll cover in part 3.</p>

            <p class="footnote" id="footnote-1"><a href="#footnote-1-source">1</a>: I'm quite certain that by now there are readers who are practically screaming at me: "but queues in product development aren't like airport check-in queues! They're not first-in, first-out. We prioritize them." This is absolutely correct, and a full response to this is beyond the scope of this article. In lieu of a full response, I'll say some provocative things here and promise to follow up with a full examination later. First, it is unlikely you are prioritizing correctly. Second, prioritizing correctly only <em>mitigates</em> the cost of queues. It doesn't solve it. Third, there is a cost to prioritizing which scales non-linearly with the size of the queue.</p>
            <p class="footnote" id="footnote-2"><a href="#footnote-2-source">2</a>: The good people at Black Swan Farming have <a href="https://blackswanfarming.com/cost-of-delay/">explained</a> cost of delay far better than I do here, and even have a handy video explainer. I recommend you check out that explanation too.</p>
            <p class="footnote" id="footnote-3"><a href="#footnote-3-source">3</a>: €50 per hour, 40 hours a week, translates to €92,000 for a full year (subtracting 6 weeks for annual leave and public holidays). Taking into account other costs of having engineers on staff, this seems like a pretty reasonable ballpark figure.</p>
